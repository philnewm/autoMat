# AutoMat
AutoMat is a plugin for Maya which creates __PBR-Material-Setups__ automatically from a selected textures folder.

## Why do I need it?
The idea is to make artists life just a __bit easier and automate__ the basics of a PBR material setup.

## What Features does it provide?
+ settings for __colorspace__ selection 
+ setup material for __Triplanar Projection__

## Planned features
+ finer controls for Triplanar Projection, Displacement and colorspaces
+ additional settings regarding the file search
+ selection for other Render Engines (Vray and Redshift are planned)

## Developed and tested using
+ OS: Fedora 35
+ Maya Version: 2022.4
+ Arnold Version: MtoA 5.2.0 (Arnold Core 7.1.3.0)
